Here are some project ideas to improve the matrix library:

Idea: Sparse Matrices
============================================================================================

// This project might be mathematically educational, and may force you to learn how
// to interface FORTRAN and C.  It will also exercise C++ concepts, e.g. probably
// inheritance.
//
// This would be a sizable project.  (Thankfully, there's no reason to finish it all in one go.)

Currently the Matrix class is written with no sparse matrix support in mind.
Sparse matrices, however, are useful.  So, let's add support!

A starting point for design:

 * Let's add a SparseMatrix class.
 * SparseMatrix will share functionality / method signatures with Matrix.  So let's find a way to enable code re-use:
 ** We probably can use inheritance:
 *** Refactor Matrix into 2 classes, AbstractMatrix and Matrix.
 *** AbstractMatrix will be an abstract base class for Matrix and SparseMatrix.
 * We should provide conversion capabilities between SparseMatrix and Matrix as desired.
 ** Consider constructor overloads, assignment operators, etc.
 * How do SparseMatrices and Matrices interact when we want to do arithmetic between them?
 ** Consult Matlab for its behavior
 ** Consider operator and function overloads to let SparseMatrix and Matrix work well together.

Some 3rd party libraries to look at for a starting point (Neil's nmath Matrix code tipped me off to these):

Idea: Round out the Matrix class with your choice of more MATLAB-like functionality;
============================================================================================

// This project might be mathematically educational, and may force you to learn how
// to interface FORTRAN and C.  But it probably won't be a great exercise in learning
// C++ in and of itself.

I started writing a Matrix class to bring MATLAB-like matrices to C++.  But I
only implemented the subset of MATLAB functionality I wanted to use at the time.
Sometimes, I skimped on efficiency for a simple implementation.

You can comb through what's in the Matrix class and see what you'd like to add.
It can be functions provided by MATLAB, or functions not in MATLAB but that you
want anyways.

One thing that is left partially crappily implemented are convolutions.  Anything
Fourier related?  Heck no.

Iterative methods?  Didn't touch them.

Hint: Consider algorithms and/or 3rd party libraries that MATLAB itself uses.
Read the MATLAB functions' documentation.  It's a fairly open book.


Idea: Look into reducing Matrix copies
============================================================================================

// This project might be educational for modern / advanced C++ topics.  It might not be easy
// as a beginner project, or necessarily the most useful improvement.  It's about an efficiency
// gain efficiency passing matrices around.

Now that C++11 support is fairly good in recent versions of gcc and other compilers, we can
look at using r-value references as a performance enhancement:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++11#Rvalue_references_and_move_constructors

I haven't thought this one through, or evaluated if copies are really a problem with the current
code-base.  (But I think they are).  Check it out at your own risk (and education).


Idea: Add error checking / exception support
============================================================================================

// This project might be educational for exception handling and for thinking about
// meaningful Exception class heirarchies.

Right now, the Matrix class does no bounds checking or checking for input sanity.
(E.g.: if you call a method expecing a 3x3 rotation matrix, it better damn well be
a 3x3 rotation matrix.  Otherwise, all hell will break loose.  Not sure if this example
is real or fictional, but you get the idea.  Segfaults are bad, mhkay.)

Such sanity checks can be a performance hit, however.  So let's add #define(s) for whether
we want to spend the cpu cycles checking things.
